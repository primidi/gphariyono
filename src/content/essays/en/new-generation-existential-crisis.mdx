Some people might aware of their existence in the first half of 20s. They often ask themself “Why did I exist?”. Not to make things look complicated, rather to embrace who really they are. It might sounds weird for some people that don't aware of this topic. It is essential actually, because it can be their leverage to know what the value they have at least to survive.

Sometime writer wonder, “Why do people not know what they really want to?”. And it can be analyzed that they aren't fully recognize the potential they have. So they seem confuse of what makes them feel fulfilled for doing something meaningful.

Especially in this gig economy era, nowadays generation who are in their 20s seem to have lost sight of what they want to do, as trivial as the job they'll be happy of doing it. Writer aware that it might be the macroeconomic problems, so they don't have a plenty options to do. However, still rather than blaming external factor let's reflect of what is in the control. So, what is it?

To know the potential, tracing back of what do like to do is the crucial part. Back to what kind of parents they are born from, next to what the legacy is passed down, environment condition (is it supportive or not?), cultural habits, educational background, and so on. By aware of each point and connecting the dots should be unlock the vision of what they can do purposely.

It is silly to blame the external factors which majorities are out of the control, rather self reflection by tracing back who really they are can be the answer of this kind of problem.
